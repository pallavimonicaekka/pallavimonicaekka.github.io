          UX Design: How to encourage people to cycle?
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2>thsi is part 2 of the project</h2> 
  <h2>Project overview </h2>
  <p class="workbody1">Urban travel is one of the biggest concerns in cities and it mainly revolves around environmental factors and sustainability. Increase in the use of light weight vehicles does not only increase air pollution but also makes traveling on the roads time-consuming and inconvenient for the travelers along with the additional cost of the refueling and maintenance of the vehicle. 

    Bicycles seem to be a cheaper and viable alternative to light weight vehicle and two-wheelers when it comes to covering short distances. Bicycles are cheap, Eco-friendly, healthy, faster in traffic and enjoyable when it comes to exploring places. 
    
    Despite obvious benefits, seldom people prefer cycling.</p>
  
  
   
  <p class="workbody1">During the user research we identified different behaviours, motivations and constraints for different possible target audience. We finally identified the target audience for the project. To read more about user reaserch, please head <a href="" class="link"> here</a></p>

    <h2>UX goals</h2>
    <ol class="workbody1">
        <li>Define problem statement</li>
        <li>Ideate on possible solutions and get feedback</li>
        <li>Iteration and final solution</li>
        <li>Faliure scenarios</li>
        <li>Service Design documents</li>
        <li>Define Touch points</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Problem statement</h2>
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dy5z3amin/image/upload/v1599475074/Cycle/Problem_Statement_Worksheet_sm3lwg.png" alt="" class="responsive">  

    <h2>Target audience</h2>
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dy5z3amin/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/v1599060903/Cycle/illustration-04_yk9ls6.png" alt="" class="responsive"> 

    <h2>Ecosystem mapping and brainstorming</h2>
    <p class="workbody1">To get a better idea of possible stakeholders in the cycling Eco-
      system, a map with possible connections between them was drafted. The connection represented possible intervention in the ecosystem.</p>

    <h2>Initial idea</h2>
     <p class="workbody1">The first primitive solution focused on <b> community support and assistance.</b></p> 
     <p class="workbody1">From the primary research, it has been seen that people
      depend on the community since not much support is provided
      from the authoritative front. Community plays an important role
      in the initiation and well as providing continuous support to people
      willing to adopt cycling. People depend on others to overcome fear
      of the road traffic, to get assistance while traveling from one place
      to another, getting information about the road or traffic situation
      and also it plays an important part in providing and nurturing the
      motivation that is required to keep that spirit going.</p>
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dy5z3amin/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/v1599578595/Cycle/Find_companions_to_ride-01_quzgz0.png" alt="" class="responsive"> 
      <p class="workbody1">The idea is to bring together people to help each other to succeed in
        the common aim that is to cycle for non-recreational purposes. The
        groups are made on the basis of geography since the travel on cycles
        for non-recreational purposes are shorter compared to recreational
        cycling. People when divided into groups according to the area they
        live would be able to provide each other with proper information
        and support in various ways necessary. The groups would be a
        mixture of enthusiastic cyclists as well as people who aren’t regular
        cyclists but wish to start cycling in near future.</p>
      
      <h2>Feedback</h2>
      <p class="workbody1">The idea was taken to 5 cyclists and they were taken through the
        scenario. The following was the feedback that was received from
        them. The feedback given by them was incorporated into the final
        concept.</p>
        <ol class="workbody1">
          <li>People are <b>not curious enough</b> explore cycling</li>
          <li>People <b> generally don’t have any connection</b> to cycling
            community</li>
          <li>There needs to be an <b> intermediate activity </b> - trial experience/
            getting to know the cyclists in the locality better - before riding for a
            non-recreational purpose</li>
          <li>It was not clear as to how the platform would be <b> discovered </b>since the user is not involved in cycling at all</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Further ideation</h2>
      <p class="workbody1">After receiving the feedback, the issues were revisited. From the
        feedback as well as the previously acquired information from the
        primary research, design opportunities were identified as follows :</p>
      <ol class="workbody1">
          <li>Help avoid <b> unsafe travel</b> ? </li>
          <li>Help people grow in the community?</li>
          <li>Bring <b> relevant information to the cyclists </b>?</li>
          <li>Help people <b> maintain their cycling activity </b>?</li>
      </ol>
