        Understanding the influences of Christianity in the villages of Katkahi parish
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2><mark>Objective</mark></h2>
  <p class="workbody1">
    The aim is to explore and collect data
    and information relevant to the tribal
    population and Christianity in Jharkhand
    and observe the trends effects of adoption
    of Christianity in contemporary times, if
    any, in terms of population and other basic
    facilities.
  </p>
  <h2><mark>Solution</mark></h2>
  <p class="workbody1">The contribution of the project includes
  the collection of data, converting the data
  from manual registers into the data format,
  analyzing it and representing the insights
  through visualizations.</p>
  <p class="workbody1">The project is deployed as a narrative in
  the form of a static newspaper article .</p>
  <a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dy5z3amin/image/upload/v1562058934/katkahi/newspaper_final_y5khd9.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dy5z3amin/image/upload/v1562058934/katkahi/newspaper_final_y5khd9.png" alt="" class="responsive"></a>
  <h2><mark>Collection of data</mark></h2>
  <p class="workbody1">
    The parish that was visited for data collection was
    ‘Katkahi’ which falls under the Roman
    Catholic Archdiocese of Ranchi. The church
    is about 135 km away from the capital of
    the state, Ranchi.
    The parish roughly has 57 villages. I was
    provided access to the baptismal records
    of the parishioners. The records were
    maintained in physical registers which
    contained their names, birth year, the year
    of baptism, village name. All the records
    were maintained according to the lineage.
  </p>
  <p class="workbody1">The church records seemed promising
    as it could help us see the influence of
    an external phenomenon in the tribal
    community at the village level. Also, the
    data hadn’t been worked upon previously
    and choosing this data would lead to the
    preservation of the data as well as extract
    insights from the same. Henceforth, this
    database along with the contemporary data
    available was decided for further analysis.</p>

  <h3>#1 Number of baptism and population of villages</h3>

  </div>
  <p class="workbody1">The visualization is a heat map with the
  year on the x-axis and the villages placed in
  the increasing order of their population in
  the y-axis.</p>
  <p class="workbody1">
    Two specific time periods can
  be seen wherein the number of
  baptism increases. One happens
  approximately between 1925-1930
  and the second happens between
  1950-1955.
  </p>
  <ol class="workbody1">
    <li>The first peak happens for the
    villages which have a comparatively
    larger population and then the
    second peak occurs for the smaller
    population.</li>
    <li>It was the smaller villages wherein the
    initial conversions took place.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>#2 Number of baptism and population of villages</h3>

  </div>
  <p class="workbody1">The line graph indicates the number of
  baptisms over the years in the whole parish
  along with the events, shown when hovered
  upon.</p>
  <ol class="workbody1">
    <li>Information about the events at the
        peaks could not be discovered during
        the research. The events collected occur
        approximately around 25 years before
        the peak of 1928.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>#3 Number of schools in each village</h3>
  <a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dy5z3amin/image/upload/v1562137492/katkahi/1_WRwXcJwQeaqpZZCEV0yiBQ_azdqso.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dy5z3amin/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/v1562137492/katkahi/1_WRwXcJwQeaqpZZCEV0yiBQ_azdqso.png" alt="" class="responsive" id="graphsize"></a>
  <p class="workbody1">The outer bars on the semi-circle indicate
    the number of baptisms with the circles
    indicating the number of schools in each
    village. The inner circle indicates the
    population of each village in 2011.</p>
  <ol class="workbody1">
    <li>The village with the most number of
        baptisms does not have a single school
        according to the census data of 2011.</li>
  </ol class="workbody1">

  <h3>#4 Establishment of schools and baptisms over the years</h3>
    <a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dy5z3amin/image/upload/a_-90/v1562137436/katkahi/1_mvK1ZpqwrQgd27jhvY_8OQ_kugjsj.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dy5z3amin/image/upload/a_-90/q_auto,f_auto/v1562137436/katkahi/1_mvK1ZpqwrQgd27jhvY_8OQ_kugjsj.png" alt="" class="responsive" id="graphsize" style=”transform:rotate(180deg);”></a>
  <p class="workbody1">The visualization has the number of
      baptisms on the left side and the number of
      schools on the right side.</p>
  <ol class="workbody1">
    <li>The peaks for baptism and also the
        establishment of schools somewhat
        coincide.</li>
