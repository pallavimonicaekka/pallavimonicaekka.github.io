          Cycleable : Encouraging people to cycle
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2>Problem</h2>
  <p class="workbody1">A lot of people don't view cycling as a mode of transportation. There are infrastructural problems contributing to
  this perception but people are also scared of riding a bicycle for small jobs also.</p>
  <h2>Goal</h2>
  <p class="workbody1">Design a service which would encourage people to cycle and see it as a viable mode of transportation.</p>
  <h2>Solution</h2>
  <p class="workbody1">A service that allows cycling enthusiasts to organize event and for non-cyclists. The primary objective of these events
  would be fun/social activities which interests people but these activities would include cycling (a secondary activity) in some manner or the other.</p>

  <p class="caption">A lot of people from the lower economic group use bicycles as a mode of trasportation.(Photo by Dewang Gupta on Unsplash)</p>
  <h2><mark>Secondary and Primary research</mark></h2>
  <p class="workbody1">From going through many services present all over the globe and also talking to cycling enthusiats and non-enthusiasts,
  The behaviour, motivations and concerns were identified.</p>
  <h4><mark>Motivations</mark></h4>
  <ol class="workbody1">
    <li>Nostalgia</li>
    <li>Recreational</li>
    <li>Health</li>
  </ol>
  <h4><mark>Constraints</mark></h4>
  <ol class="workbody1">
    <li>Rude behaviour towards cyclists on road</li>
    <li>Insufficient infrastructure</li>
    <li>Fear on road</li>
  </ol>
  <h2><mark>Target User</mark></h2>
  <p class="workbody1">This would be a person who has never attended a cycling event
    neither have any of his friends. He doesn’t see cycling as a mode of
    transport but rather something you would do only out of interest.
    He thinks that cycling on the city roads would be unsafe.</p>
  <ol class="workbody1">
      <li>The number of people who are not motivated to cycle in the first
      place are more in number. Increasing that number and bring them
      into the community would help bring about other policy level
      changes in the society.</li>
      <li>Cycling enthusiats have more infrastructure level interventions needed
      which could be solved through policies in place or with a stronger
      community and a higher number of cyclists which could again be
      achieved by targeting non-enthusiats.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2><mark>Connecting dots</mark></h2>
  <p class="workbody1">In order to identify relations and ultimately solutions to this problem, an eco-system map was created
  generating possible scope and areas in which solutions can be build.</p>

  <h2><mark>Concept walkthrough</mark></h2>

  <p class="workbody1">The objective of the solution is to help the users grow in their journey as a cyclist. Hence, the service caters to
  three different phases from attending event organized by others to organizing event themselves.</p>
  <h4><mark>Phase 1</mark></h4>
  <p class="workbody1">In phase-1, events are organized by the service provider. The events
  are such that they are indirectly related to cycling. The events are
  of 2 categories - one involves cycling, the other doesn’t. The cycling
  events are further divided into 2 parts -<b>data collection events and
  social cause</b> . The non-cycling events are creative lessons with the
  subject of cycling such as product photography with the cycle as the
  subject. The tickets to these events would be available on the website
  where you can also find blog articles on cycling, products related to
  cycling and a information about how you could become a part of the
  cycling community (managing and organizing event, writing blog
  articles, providing parking space).</p>
  <h4>Benefit</h4>
  <p class="workbody1">The events act as a channel for non-cyclists to become a part of the
  cycling community and increase their interest in cycling and also on
  the way get more experience with the activity of cycling.</p>
  <h4><mark>Phase 2</mark></h4>
  <p class="workbody1">In phase-2, the service provider starts inviting regular customers to
  become managers for the event organized by the service provider
  in collaboration with organizations (NGOs). The tasks would be
  defined by the NGO along with the service provider and would be
  specifically be mentioned to the person who signs up to become a
  manager. The managers will receive incentives for their service.</p>
  <h4>Benefit</h4>
  <p class="workbody1">This helps the non-cyclists to be more involved in the events and
  develop a sense of belongingness to the community. This helps
  maintain the cycling activities and get closer to becoming a cycling
  enthusiasts.</p>
  <h4><mark>Phase 3</mark></h4>
  <p class="workbody1">In phase-3, the service provider starts inviting the already existing
  managers to organize their own events which will be facilitated by
  the service provider. The person invited would have to decide on
  the details of the event, the location, the number of people, time
  etc. The events could be of wide variety and would be verified by
  the service provider as suitable and probable. The event would then be put up on the website and open for people to sign in. The
  profit earned would be divided between the service provider and the
  organizer.</p>
  <h4>Benefit</h4>
  <p class="workbody1">The user gets to be the cycling enthusiasts and can also earn some
  money out of his love for cycling. This also helps build a community
  as a person who was once a non-cyclist would get an opportunity to
  be a contributer to the society as a cyclist.
  The cyclists could write articles on the blog that could create a
  following which would help him bring more crowd to the events
  that are organized by him/her.</p>
  <h2><mark>Failure points</mark></h2>
  <h4><mark>Scenario 1</mark></h4>
  <p class="workbody1">Akshay spent some hours at the data collection activity but he doesn’t know what happened to the information that was collected and how that was being used. His hardwork wasn’t visible and hence he didn’t feel like attending another similar event.</p>
  <h4>Possible solution</h4>
  <p class="workbody1">The collected data can then be represent on a open map which
    would be available for public use.</p>
  <h4><mark>Scenario 2</mark></h4>
  <p class="workbody1">Arjun buys a ticket to a weekend lesson in photography. He attends
  the event but doesn’t find it worthy enough.
  </p>
  <h4>Possible solution</h4>
  <p class="workbody1">People will be asked to review the event and if 60% of the reviews
  are negative then either the amount could be refunded or they could
  sign up for another event.</p>
  <h2><mark>Evaluation</mark></h2>
  <p class="workbody1">For the purpose of evaluation, an event was organized to simulate
  the experience for the participants. A poster was put up in hostels
  to invite people to take part in an event wherein they would meet
  and spend time with underprivileged children studying at an NGO
  named ‘ASHA MUMBAI’. The travel to the NGO was to be made
  on bicycles. The core of the event was to spend quality time with
  children and cycling was just a part of the whole experience.
  The purpose of the evaluation was to know if the participants felt
  that cycling was an additional burden on them during the event and
  if it overpowered the essence of the core of the event.</p>

    <p class="caption">We cycled to the school and distributed doughnuts to the kids for the new year.</p>

  <h3><mark>Feedback from participants</mark></h3>
  <ol class="workbody1">
    <li>The suitability of the cycle was a major issue</li>
    <li>The timing of the event would also be a factor since we would
        be riding on the road in the traffic</li>
    <li>Cycling was found difficult but the intermediate event was
        liked and compensated for cycling</li>
  </ol>
