          UX Research: Why don't people cycle?
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2>Project overview </h2>
  <p class="workbody1">Urban travel is one of the biggest concerns in cities and it mainly revolves around environmental factors and sustainability. Increase in the use of light weight vehicles does not only increase air pollution but also makes traveling on the roads time-consuming and inconvenient for the travelers along with the additional cost of the refueling and maintenance of the vehicle. 

    Bicycles seem to be a cheaper and viable alternative to light weight vehicle and two-wheelers when it comes to covering short distances. Bicycles are cheap, Eco-friendly, healthy, faster in traffic and enjoyable when it comes to exploring places. 
    
    Despite obvious benefits, seldom people prefer cycling. The objective was to identify the reasons for the same.</p>

  <h2>Research goals</h2>
  <ol class="workbody1">
      <li>Observe and understand bicycle environments/ institutions across globe</li>
      <li>Notable behaviours, preferences, barriers and technologies that impact usage of the bicycle</li>
      <li>Identify needs and opportunities to inform the product design strategy</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <h4 style="color:rgb(61, 61, 61);">Where and when will the research be carried out?</h4>
  <p class="workbody1">The research was carried out in Mumbai (urban) during summer of 2017</p>

  <h4 style="color:rgb(61, 61, 61);">What kind of Data needs to be collected?</h4>
  <p class="workbody1">Data about the behaviour, motivations and concerns of cyclists and non-cyclists 

    Since the research is exploratory in nature and deals with understanding behaviour, thoughts and experiences, qualitative data collection was preferred over quantitative data.</p>

  <h4 style="color:rgb(61, 61, 61);">Where is this data? How do we acquire it?</h4>
  <p class="workbody1">The data can be acquired from articles, papers, books and from individuals. The data can be acquired from online platforms as well as offline.</p>

  <h4 style="color:rgb(61, 61, 61);">What is the Method for collecting data?</h4>
  <p class="workbody1">Primary data - face to face interviews, engaging with people on social media platforms <br> Secondary data - published data, books, magazines, journals </p>
  </ol>

  <h2>Secondary data</h2>
  <p class="workbody1">Examples of Current Interventions to encourage cycling were identified and studied from all over the world. These innterventions could be categorized as:</p>
  <ol class="workbody1">
      <li>Cultural Acceptance: Which reflects in the policies by the government</li>
      <li>Technological Intervention: SocialCycle app, MoBike, Strava</li>
      <li>Social Initiatives: cycle2college, cycle2school</li>
      <li>Online social media groups </li>
  </ol>
  <p class="workbody1">A swot analysis was conducted on the existing different cultural, social and technological interventions.</p>

  <h2>Primary data</h2>
  <h3>Phase 1: Survey</h3>
  <p class="workbody1">
    The primary research was conducted in two phases. First phase or
    the pilot phase was to understand current scenario of the perception,
    usage and possible cycling opportunities for people. <br>The survey
    conducted with 37 participants (28 non-cyclists, 9 cyclists).
    Convenience sampling was done to select the participants for the
    primary research with the common factor being that all of them
    were residents of Mumbai.
  </p>
  <h4>Pro</h4>
  <p class="workbody1">
    Helped in identification of my types of users and narrow down on target audience
  </p>
  <h4>Con</h4>
  <p class="workbody1">
    Did not have access to a large sample. For such a project which needs to involve a large population, the survey conducted was extremely small and hence cannot be called statistically significant.
  </p>

  <hr class="workbody1">

<h3>Phase 2: Interviews</h3>
<p class="workbody1">
  After getting an overall idea as to what the current scenario and
  perception of cycling is of the probable target audience was, further
  interviews were conducted with 7 participants out of which 4 were
  cyclists (of age 25, 27, 32) and 3 were non-cyclists (23, 25, 26). The
  interview was conducted to understand their behavior, constraints
  and motivation.
</p>
<h4>Pro</h4>
  <p class="workbody1">
    Helped explain, better understand, and explore research subjects' opinions, behavior, experiences, phenomenon, etc. Interview questions are usually open-ended questions so that in-depth information will be collected. 
  </p>
  <h4>Con</h4>
  <p class="workbody1">
    Did not have enough participants (For practical reasons Crouch & McKenzie (2006) propose that less than 20 participants in a qualitative study helps a researcher build and maintain a close relationship and thus improve the “open” and “frank” exchange of information.)
